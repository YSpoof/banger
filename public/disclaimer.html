  The goal of this project is to make it easier and efficient for people to access results of websites that provide a search mechanism. All content available through this project is OBVIOUSLY hosted by external non-affiliated sources. 
  
  <br>
  
  <b>All search engines provided through this project are PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE.</b>
  
  Think of this project as a wrapper for your normal Google, DuckDuckGo, YouTube or whatever search engine you can think of, but a bit more straight-forward and specific. Instead of you needing to go to the main website to then do your search, this project aims to redirect you to your search results directly on the specific provider, bypassing their 'home screen', slowness to load and related stuff.
  
  <b>
  
  This project is to be used at the user's OWN RISK, based on their government and laws.
  
  This project has NO CONTROL over the content it JUST redirect the user! Using copyrighted content from the providers is not going to be accounted for by the developer. Again, it is the user's own risk.

  <h2>DMCA and Copyright Infrigements</h3>
  
  <br>
  
  <b>
  
  A wrapper is JUST a tool, and the maliciousness of the tool is directly based on the user's actions.
  </b>
  
  
  <p>This project uses client-side content access mechanisms. Hence, the copyright infringements or DMCA in this project's regards are to be forwarded to the associated site by the associated notifier of any such claims. This is one of the main reasons the search engines are listed in this project. Keep in mind that your IP address as a user is directly accessible to the search engines.</p>
